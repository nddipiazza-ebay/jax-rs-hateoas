JAX-RS-HATEOAS is a small extension to JAX-RS to enable hypermedia in JAX-RS 1.x applications.

In 1.0.0 release I have removed the spring servlet. And focused on the support of Jersey 3.x only.

Adding hypermedia to your existing application is easily done in four steps:
* Extend HateoasApplication (or JerseyHateoasApplication)
* Add @Linkable annotations to all methods that should be linkable.
* Use HateoasResponse instead for building responses with HATEOAS links.
  The normal Response methods (ok, created, entity, etc.) will now return a HateoasResponseBuilder.
  The HateoasResponseBuilder contains methods to easily add links to your responses:
** link(String linkId, String rel, Object... params) - adds a link to the referenced linkId
   (as defined by an @Linkable annotation).
** selfLink(String linkId, Object... params) - adds a link to the referenced linkId with a 'self' rel
   (rather than the default rel defined in the referenced @Linkable annotation
** ...etc
